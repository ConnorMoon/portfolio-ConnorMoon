            <p>This is the third VR demo. It demonstrates the UI components in Unity and their interactions with a VR rig. First, is the button modules, which are used to spawn objects. Second, we see the toggle feature and its ability to set objects inactive. Next, we see drop-down menus and their combined effect on an object. Last, we see the slider elements and how they can change the scale of an object.</p>
