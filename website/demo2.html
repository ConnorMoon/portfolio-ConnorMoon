            <p>This is the second VR demo. It demonstrates the pipeline of creating assets in Blender and importing them to Unity. The first example is simple primitives with materials attached. Next, we have complex objects, created with Blender's modifiers, sculpting, and importing tools. Later you will see textured objects: different attributes, multi-textured objects, and an image sequence as a texture. Finally, we have animated objects imported from Blender. Both are manipulated using the armature feature in Blender.</p>
